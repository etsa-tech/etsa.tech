Have you ever dreamed of writing a script so advanced it can make backups of itself, completely transform its environment, or even code by itself in a different language? If so, you've come to the right place. In this talk, we will discuss Metaprogramming and how to do it with PowerShell. We will describe and outline how to use PowerShell to write your code for you, all while maintaining the ability to adapt to your environment. Focusing on use cases, we will highlight some examples that you may have seen in the real world in products like Microsoft System Center, and others. We will demonstrate how to rebuild AD (Sites & Services, Users, OU structure, and more) via dynamically generated scripts, build T-SQL statements, and how to build some very dynamic functions all with minimal code.

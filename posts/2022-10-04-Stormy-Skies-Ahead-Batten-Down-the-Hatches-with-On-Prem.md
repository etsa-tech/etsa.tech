    bio: >-
      Michael Campfield is a Linux systems administrator with Leidos whose listed office is at a CDC facility in Atlanta skulking around the bioinformatics HPC group. As with most systems administrators he has worn many hats, frequently all at once. Something something Puppet and Ansible, something something, cloud, automation... Most importantly, Michael is seeking an academic librarianship MLIS degree from IUPUI (Go Jags!). He isn't seeking for a career change - just wants to say he is a computer scientist and a librarian. Verified by Guinness as the weirdest midlife crisis activity ever. Though a resident of East Tennessee for over twenty years, Michael's origins in Upstate New York means he eats only sweet cornbread but never drinks sweet tea.

"We are moving everything to the cloud!" "Why?" "Uh, the vendor told us cloud made everything super awesome and saved us money." "Is this the same vendor who sold us our $950K VMware stack 3 years ago?" "But they gave me a koozie AND a t-shirt this time." The cloud is a game changer, but beyond that statement, when is it better for you and your customers to just keep a half-rack of systems in your office broom closet and the DevOps platform on a PC under your developers' desks? Is hybrid cloud an in-between stage or a permanent fixture? We are going to have a presentation and dialog - you heard that right - a dialog!

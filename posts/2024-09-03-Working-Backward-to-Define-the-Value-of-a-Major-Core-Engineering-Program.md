Imagine taking over a major infrastructure project that is 1 year overdue with no end in sight. What do you do? Well, first you need to figure out if you should kill the thing! Once you've figured out the answer to that, it's about effective execution. During this talk, I'll talk through how i worked backwards to define outcome milestones for a major core engineering program and helped reorganized the team structure to better align to the outcomes we were driving. I'll also explain the various skillsets of Technical Program Management I leveraged to ensure effective program definition and delivery.

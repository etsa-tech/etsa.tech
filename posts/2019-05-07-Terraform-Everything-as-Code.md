Infrastructure as Code is so 2017. Now, we want Everything as Code! We'll introduce HashiCorp terraform and discuss how to use it to provision cloud resources in Amazon Web Services. We'll also use terraform to manage related non-infrastructure services. Together, we can create real-world deployments that require no manual intervention!

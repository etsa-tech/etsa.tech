The lecture aims at familiarizing users with common tools to work efficiently and effectively in Linux environment. We will build powerful command lines that will help save time accomplishing common tasks and enable users to conceive and execute complex tasks with ease. Age-old and time tested productivity concepts such as pipelines, session management, regular expressions will be discussed. Additionally, techniques such as fast navigation on the command line, and tools such as find, grep, awk, and sed will be discussed.

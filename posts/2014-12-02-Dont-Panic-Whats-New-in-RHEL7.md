There's been a lot of talk surrounding the changes RedHat has made in the latest release of it's flagship operating system, RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In changing key components, many worry that RedHat has affected the reliability, manageability, and scalability of the core components of this popular operating system. This talk will focus on separating fact from FUD by highlighting some of the key differences between RHEL 6.5 and RHEL 7.

Phishing is the most common form of cyber crime, with an estimated 3.4 billion spam emails sent every day. Google blocks around 100 million phishing emails daily. Over 48% of emails sent in 2022 were spam. Over a fifth of phishing emails originate from Russia. (statistics shamelessly stolen from another company online) Aegis IT helps clients recognize and detect these phishing emails to help prevent clients from becoming yet another statistic. We have a Gophish ecosystem setup, and have learned quite a bit to get our system running as smoothly as we do. We will be going over our setup and discussing a variety of problems we encountered when setting up the system. We offer this as a paid service, but you too can set this up and run this as a red team exercise for your own company!

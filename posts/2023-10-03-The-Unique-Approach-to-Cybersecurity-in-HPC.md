    bio: >-
      Tori Robinson attended a summer camp at Mississippi State University in the 11th grade with no prior knowledge of computer science and left certain that computer science was the field for her. She obtained her B.S. and M.S. degrees from Mississippi State University, with her main focus being Cyber Security combined with Engineering Education. She never forgot the lasting impact that one summer camp had on her career, so she decided to give back to the community that changed her life. She dedicated most of her time at MSU to teaching and hosting summer classes and robotics camps aimed at increasing computer science/cyber security engagement for young minority students and women. After graduation, Tori came to ORNL as a Post Master's student and is now a full time HPC Cybersecurity Engineer for the HPC Cybersecurity & Information Engineering Group.

The Department of Energy fields some of the world's fastest supercomputers. Unlike private industry, HPC security has a different set of challenges, often prioritizing performance. Because of this, we must come up with innovate solutions to meet supercomputing needs. To support the open-science mission of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), the OLCF security team designs and deploys state-of-the-art cybersecurity tools and best practices. In this seminar, we will lightly cover some of the common tools and techniques used by the OLCF security team, and will also talk about the types of security career paths that exist for technical professionals within the STEM field. Finally, the speaker's personal career path will be shared, along with some general advice for navigating life, growing technology, and finding great places to work.

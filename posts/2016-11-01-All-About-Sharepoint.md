Rob Barker will offer us insight from his extensive experience with SharePoint, and how he implements it in the ORNL environment. He will discuss the different types of roles that are required to implement, maintain, and support SharePoint, as well as present a show-and-tell on his new dev SP 2016 farm, and where ORNL is going with it.

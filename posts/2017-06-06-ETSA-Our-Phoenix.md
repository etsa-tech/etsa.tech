Our LOPSA East Tennessee Local Chapter we call ETENN is evolving and growing. We were displaced last year from our home in downtown Knoxville, and we've been struggling with the situation and our future. A small committee formed to create ETSA, a new organization that will be our Phoenix rising from the ashes of our past troubles. Join us to hear the details of the impetus for a new organization, the solution, and the future from ETENN and ETSA co-founder Jesse Trucks.

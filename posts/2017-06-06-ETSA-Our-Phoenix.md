    bio: "Jesse Trucks has been involved with the formation and management of professional communities for over 13 years. His initiation into professional community involvement began with co-authoring, as part of a committee, the original version of the Code of Ethics currently adopted by The League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA), USENIX, and LISA. In the following years, he helped manage a local SAGE chapter (the precursor to LISA); was a Founding Member of LOPSA; formed and managed the successful LOPSA Madison Local Chapter; served on the LOPSA Board of Directors from 2007 - 2013; founded and still manages the LOPSA East Tennessee Local Chapter; and is a senior freenode IRC network staff member and the freenode Sponsor Liaison. Over the years, Trucks has seen how professional communities wax and wane through successes and failures, and he advocates that all professionals get involved in their own professional communities to the betterment of everyone involved."

Our LOPSA East Tennessee Local Chapter we call ETENN is evolving and growing. We were displaced last year from our home in downtown Knoxville, and we've been struggling with the situation and our future. A small committee formed to create ETSA, a new organization that will be our Phoenix rising from the ashes of our past troubles. Join us to  hear the details of the impetus for a new organization, the solution, and the future from ETENN and ETSA co-founder Jesse Trucks.

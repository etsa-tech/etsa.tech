Cloud-dependent IoT devices are really just bots controlled by a "trusted" C2. This talk will dive into a quick-and-dirty demo of using Home Assistant to take control of your smart home. I will cover multiple methods to force devices to be locally controlled. Some can be flashed with open-source firmware, others can be tricked into pairing with a locally emulated hub. I'll also touch on risk appetite and why a DIY approach has some strings attached. At the end, I hope you'll walk away excited to nerd out on some new projects!

Containers are a stage, and the processes we run in them are often unwitting stars. In this talk, we'll peek behind the curtain to get a better understanding of the fictions needed to create these stages. We'll also look at how different operating systems attempt to combine those fictions into a compelling reality, such that neither we nor our applications need be any the wiser.

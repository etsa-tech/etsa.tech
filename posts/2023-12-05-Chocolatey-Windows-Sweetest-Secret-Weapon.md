    bio: >-
      I'm Stephen Valdinger, or "Steviecoaster" as some might know me in the PowerShell world. I've been a technologist for 2 decades (cries a little inside), and an automation aficionado with PowerShell for a number of them. I love meeting people where they are and helping to make them better. I also play music, and have a slight Lego addiction and a killer bourbon collection.

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows allowing you to quickly and easily install and manage software on your Windows workstation(s).

The talk will focus mainly on Chocolatey CLI and its use, but we'll briefly look at the Chocolatey For Business features for awareness.

"I have $40,000,000 USD locked in a country, and I need your help to get it out - for a small fee, of course." "Please click on this file to see the shipping details for a package you never ordered that was actually never delivered. Or maybe the invoice for it." Financial scammers like these are typically easy to avoid when you have a modicum of common sense on the internet. However, how do you respond when someone asks you to pay an invoice? To company that you may not recognize? For an amount that may or may not be a rounding error? I recently had two clients almost lose money to this same scam. I will compare both compromises to discuss why these attacks are so effective, and IT can help prevent this from being possible in the first place.

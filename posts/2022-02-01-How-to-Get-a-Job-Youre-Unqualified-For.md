While job hunting, ever felt that little thrill when you come across what seems like that perfect job, only to feel intimidated when you read the full description? They want more time, more education, more skills, someone younger (or older), smarter, quicker, prettier... and before you finish reading, you've thought yourself out and away from another opportunity. "I'm not qualified!" Of course there are jobs out there that we're not qualified for – we're not brain surgeons or rocket scientists, but that description you just read was for neither one of those. And even if your experience and their description don't match, that doesn't mean you're not a good fit. What's more, that initial spark you felt for the job was probably more relevant than its description. In this talk, we'll re-think what "qualified" means – how your future promises more than the summary of your past, how there is more to you than the sum of your experience, and despite what your imposter syndrome may tell you, the job you want is in fact the job you deserve!

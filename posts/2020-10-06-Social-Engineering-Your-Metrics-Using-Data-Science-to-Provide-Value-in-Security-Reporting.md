Reporting is generally boring. Social engineering security consultants often get wrapped up in the hustle and bustle of performing the engagement and report writing falls to the side. While the reports do go out and we meet client obligations, a serious question arises: Are we providing meaningful measurements, metrics, and advice to the client? We surely highlight the deficiencies and where to improve in a report, which is pretty standard. How do we measure the things that matter most to the client? Measuring 'opens' just tells us how many people read their email and, while risky, clicks do not always translate to negative outcomes. Instead of focusing on email opens or links clicked by users, this presentation introduces measurements rooted in statistics, data science techniques, and indicators that actually speak to the security posture and culture of the organization.

It seems about every other day I read some poorly written article talking about "so and so got hacked" providing no detail of any use except "it was the APTz and they used 0dayz n' stuff". One the other hand, other articles that make headlines are discussing "Researchers break SSL" and what they forget to mention/dont understand is that in the fine print it says the browser has to be running some specific configuration and the server has to be angled in some strange way and you need to have at least three NICs installed for there to be a chance that a cookie will be intercepted. This talk will attempt to detail multiple real world attacks (ones that actually get you owned) in a "lessons learned" format.

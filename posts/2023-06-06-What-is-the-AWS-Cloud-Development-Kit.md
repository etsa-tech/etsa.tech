The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source project that allows you to create your infrastructure in a major programming language of your choice, such as Python, Java, Javascript, or C#/.Net. This allows you to build and use high level constructs of infrastructure with sensible defaults, package it in reusable modules, and track versions of your architecture as it changes. A single line of code can deploy extremely complex infrastructure changes that have already been reviewed and approved. Come learn the basics of AWS CDK!

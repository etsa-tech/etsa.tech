This month's topic is a preview of the upcoming USENIX LISA 2014 workshop of the same name. This will be a fast-paced, highly interactive discussion to find new ways to describe modern sysadmin jobs. The point is to learn about the most common ideas about our roles, qualifications, and career paths. In order to create the best educational programs and provide the best support for sysadmin career progression, we need to better understand what we expect of sysadmins in different jobs and how we can connect those things to each other.

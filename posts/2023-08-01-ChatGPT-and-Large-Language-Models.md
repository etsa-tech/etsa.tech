Panel discussion covering: What (cool and unique) business use-cases are we seeing customers deploy LLM's or Deep Learning for? Things specific you should consider if your company is looking at an LLM project? Are there any vendors who are "doing it right" (Microsoft, Google, etc)? What does it take to build out an LLM or Deep Learning environment? The Microsoft roadmap for ChatGPT. Who are the competitors and who seems to be winning in that game? LLM's and company policies.

    bio: "With almost two decades of IT experience behind him, Chris is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, especially if they involve Linux. He currently serves on the R&D Linux Engineering team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory where he helps support the technical needs of the lab's many scientific research projects. His prior experience includes working as part of a two man engineering team at a Tier 1 ISP, a year long stint as a Senior Systems Engineer at Peak Hosting, and also supporting ORNL's supercomputing effort as a member of the HPC Operations Infrastructure team. When not chasing packets or bending Linux systems to do his bidding, his time is spent trying to keep pace with his daughter, exploring the local hiking haunts, playing with embedded Linux systems, and driving mountain roads in small two seater automobiles."

At February's meeting we will be discussing an often overlooked part of our hardware platform, the Out of Band device. This technology, which goes by names such as Drac, IPMI, and BMC, is a powerful tool for managing systems. The talk will be a high level overview of OOB management including how to interact with the devices that support it, basic automation examples, its role in root cause analysis, and even how it can play a part in your monitoring infrastructure.

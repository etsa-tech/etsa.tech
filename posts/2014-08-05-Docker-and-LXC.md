    bio: >-
      Chris St. Pierre is a recovering sysadmin serving the eleventh year of a life sentence of hard labor at the command line. His work release has him breaking rocks in the hot sun as an OpenStack developer for Los Angeles-based Metacloud, and he also serves as a principal developer of Bcfg2, the greatest configuration management system you've probably never heard of. When he was still young and beautiful he taught and spoke about configuration management, spam LDAP, documentation, and many other topics.

You can't swing a dead cat on Hacker News without hitting a jillion whizzbang brogrammers talking about how all-fired amazing Docker is. We'll spend a short hour tinkering with and learning about Docker, which, unlike most technologies that get this much hype, will actually probably will change your life for the better in the next five years. We'll cover the basics of building, shipping, and running containers, talk about what actually makes Docker awesome (hint: it's not actually the containerization bits), and explore some of the rough edges where there's still lots of work being done. You'll leave 5% smarter and 50% hipper.

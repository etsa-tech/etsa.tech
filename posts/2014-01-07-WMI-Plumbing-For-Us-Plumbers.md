      Dale has over 30 years of experience supporting systems at the end of the wire, sometimes continents away from his comfortable seat. WMI became a necessary tool in his toolkit years ago.

Windows Management Instrumentation is the Microsoft implementation of the Common Information Model (CIM) standard that has been provided with all Windows distributions since Windows 2000. WMI provides the interface that enables remote users or applications to view, monitor and control system details. Almost all inventory, system management/monitoring tools on the market are based on WMI. Dale will attempt to clear the fog and provide an understanding of WMI, and thus CIM, that every SA that manages remote system should understand.

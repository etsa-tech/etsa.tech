Currently, he works for Scripps Networks as the manager of the Application Engineering and Automation group, which is responsible for a large number and wide variety of environments, from legacy Windows apps, to DevOps-style Linux web deployments, both on-prem and in the cloud.  He has been responsible for some of the top destinations on the Internet, such as HGTV.com, Dilbert.com, and Metallica.com.

This presentation demonstrates the practical application of AI-assisted development in rebuilding our organization's web presence. We will share how agentic AI tools transformed our 14-year-old, non-responsive website into a modern, secure, serverless application using Next.js with modern libraries. We will cover the complete development journey, from initial requirements gathering to deployment on Netlify, highlighting how AI coding assistants enabled a DevOps engineer to accomplish web development tasks traditionally requiring specialized frontend expertise. Key topics include modern web architecture, security best practices with comprehensive CI/CD scanning, third-party integrations and the benefits of open-source development. You will learn how AI tools can accelerate development while maintaining code quality and security standards, and not generate "AI Slop" ultimately delivering a cost-effective, maintainable solution that serves our community's needs.

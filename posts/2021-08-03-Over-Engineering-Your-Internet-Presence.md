    bio: >-
      Over the last several years, Wesley Kirkland has cut his teeth doing Systems Engineering work until he got the opportunity to become a real boy again and move to a cloud-centric infrastructure role. Currently, he is a Sr. Cloud Engineer at Ministry Brands, working with AWS & Azure with PowerShell daily. Though somehow his old life follows him and he still does networking.

A common stereotype is that technical people have no people skills. Frequently, it is a well-earned stereotype! If you are like me, being great at customer service is _NOT_ why you entered into a technical field. However, almost all technical roles require helping other people in some way, and there are common mistakes I keep encountering when interacting with other technical people. I hope to make a case for why this skill is important, explain common mistakes made, and address how to handle typical people problems that arise in the process.

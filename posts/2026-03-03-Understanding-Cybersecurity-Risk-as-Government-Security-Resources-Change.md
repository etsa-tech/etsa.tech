**Topic: Evolving Cyber Threats: Understanding Risk as Government Security Resources Change**

Cyber threats evolve within a broader security ecosystem. As government posture for cybersecurity resources, priorities, and operational capacity changes, organizations in the private sector may experience downstream effects in attacker behavior, exploit activity, and overall risk exposure.

This session establishes a practical foundation for understanding threat actors, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and modern attack patterns before examining how shifts in the external security landscape can influence business vulnerability.

Topics will include:

- Trends in exploitation versus phishing-based attacks
- Growth in ransomware activity
- Shared technology risks across sectors
- Patch and remediation challenges
- Where organizations may need to adapt their defensive strategy

Attendees will leave with a clearer understanding of emerging pressures on cyber defense and actionable considerations for strengthening organizational resilience.

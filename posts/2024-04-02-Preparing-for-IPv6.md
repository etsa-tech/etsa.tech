During the mid 1990's, Internet wasn't essential. Fast forward to today, and the Internet involves every aspect of our lives at work and at home and all around us. Everything evolves, changes. When we think about music media changes from 8-track tape, to cassettes, to CD's to MP3s those were drastic changes. The Internet has changed greatly in speeds, and various applications over the past 40 years, but has kept the same address system for most of us. This presentation will compare IPv4 and IPv6, the history in how we got to IPv6, and how to prepare for IPv6. These preparations will include how to understand the addressing, considering application use, and considering security. This will conclude with many recommendations on best practices and things to consider.

Do you like interviews? Does the thought of explaining how to move Mount Everest or fit ping-pong balls into a 747 take you to the heights of excitement or drop you to the depths of despair? What makes a good interview? How do you know if it was successful? This presentation will cover both sides of an interview: what to do, what not to do, what to look for, and what you might want to get from one (besides a new job or a new employee). The goal will be to help you avoid common mistakes that keep getting made, especially by people who are more technically inclined, as well as what to focus on to have a successful interview.

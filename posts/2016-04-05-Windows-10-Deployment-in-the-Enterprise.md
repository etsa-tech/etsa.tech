With plenty of reasons to migrate to Windows 10, ORNL began defaulting all installs/reinstalls to the new platform in February, utilizing Microsoftâ€™s latest deployment tool technologies. Obviously, there are many factors to take into account prior to such a deployment, yet there are many opportunities to introduce enhancements for operations, support, security, as well as improving users' mobility and productivity. In this presentation, we will discuss the migration path ORNL chose, issues we experienced along the way, and strategies employed to ensure a smooth transition, such as Windows 10 configurations, management and patching, browser compatibility, and security enhancements. Additionally, we will highlight our testing, training, and communications methods, and how Windows 10 has been accepted and utilized by the ORNL community.

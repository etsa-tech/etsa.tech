In an age where data breaches and malware infections are quickly becoming the norm, we must prepare for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Most DFIR talks and advice discuss what to do once an incident has occurred. Instead, this talk provides Security Architects, System Administrators, SOC teams, and management new techniques and advice to supercharge their IR capabilities by preemptively collecting forensic evidence as a baseline. The content provided in this presentation goes beyond the age-old advice of verbose logging and asset inventories. It will promote a cooperative relationship between DFIR and the rest of the "Blue Team." We will kick this presentation off with a discussion about Threat Hunting versus Forensics. During this presentation, blue teamers and management will be armed with actionable advice as to how to pre-preemptively capture artifacts as baselines BEFORE anything ever happens and the actions to take WHEN something happens.

We work in IT and our technical skills are the foundation upon which we build our careers. Whether it's writing code, managing systems or networks, or securing our environments, technology matters. Something that I didn't fully realize until much later in my career than I wish was that something other than my technical expertise can matter as much or more - my ability to function as part of a team and communicate effectively and positively with my teammates and customers. I'm going to share my experience receiving training in the soft skills and the difference that sort of training has made for me and my team members.

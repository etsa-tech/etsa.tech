    bio: >-
      With over two decades of IT experience behind him, Chris is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, especially if they involve Linux. He currently serves on Research Cloud Team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory where he helps support the technical needs of the lab's many scientific research projects. His prior experience includes working as part of a two man engineering team at a Tier 1 ISP, a year long stint as a Senior Systems Engineer at Peak Hosting, and also supporting ORNL's supercomputing effort as a member of the HPC Operations Infrastructure team. When not chasing packets or bending Linux systems to do his bidding, his time is spent trying to keep pace with his daughter, exploring the local hiking haunts, playing with embedded Linux systems, and driving mountain roads in small two seater automobiles.

Memphis, TN, 1990's. A precocious young DIY enthusiast immerses himself in this new OS called Linux. After several support calls to his local ISP, in which he found himself actually guiding them through their troubleshooting, they offer him a job on their staff. It's a revelatory moment: "You can make a living at this?" This Meet-Cute moment turns into a passionate love story and an exciting journey of discovery. Linux is more than just another computing tool, it's also a journey companion, and a realm unto itself with unlimited opportunities for life adventures. Our protagonist in this story is Chris Layton, and this talk is his Linux origin story. For both the seasoned veteran, and those just beginning their computing journey, this back-to-roots talk is a must-not-miss.

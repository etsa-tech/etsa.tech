    bio: "Bruce Wilson is an Enterprise Architect at ORNL, working particularly on authentication, authorization, remote access, and mobility.  He is a chemist by original training, and he spent 18 years in the chemical industry, working for Eastman Chemical Company, Dow Corning, and the Dow Chemical Company.  Much of that work was very data-intensive, particularly the work on high throughput methods in material sciences.  He migrated from writing tools to help get his own work done to making those tools available to others, to taking on more of an IT role in enabling scientists to do science.

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a very useful tool for an organization to allow its users to sign into external cloud applications without having to have application specific usernames and passwords.  It is also useful for a service provider to let users “bring their own accounts."

This talk will provide an overview of how SAML works, differences between SAML and OAuth, the design choices which drove ORNL’s particular implementation, some tips and tricks for working with SAML, and some preliminary work in developing some penetration testing tools for testing SAML implementations.

    bio: >-
      Antonio Quintero-Hernandez began his IT journey as a Computer Science major, and while he enjoyed learning some C++, he was drawn to Enterprise IT as an alternative path. For him it seemed the perfect fit in which he could develop and balance the application of both technical and soft skills. He has been an intern at Master Service Companies since February where he has learned much about day-to-day IT infrastructure support, and applied much of what he has learned as a System Administration and Networking major at Pellissippi State Community College.

PhpIPAM is an open sourced, web based IP management application. It is php-based with a MySQL backend that uses Jquery libraries, ajax, and HTML5/CSS3 features. During my internship, I have been tasked with installing and configuring phpIPAM on Master Service Company's network. Join me as I share what I have learned, and the benefits of this application for Enterprise IT.

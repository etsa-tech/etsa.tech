What happens when the cloud service you rely on becomes unreliable? This is what happened to some 500 Atlassian cloud customers this past April when a script intended to deactivate an obsolete service actually deactivated live services, and even permanently deleted customer data. In this month's talk, we will be taking a closer look at Atlassian's Post-Incident Review, with particular focus improving upon Atlassian's post-incident response for both business and technical operations, and what we can learn from Atlassian's own Root Cause Analysis to strengthen our own infrastructure management. Regardless of the extent to which your organization's infrastructure is on-prem or in the cloud, there are lessons here each of us can take with us as we strive to provide reliable and resilient services to our stakeholders.

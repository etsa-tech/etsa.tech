    bio: >-
      Robert French is an unemployed trust-fund baby whose opinions on technology are heavily influenced by his lack of ever having run anything in production. He is a 2-bit Brendan Gregg impersonator who regularly steals presentation material from James Mickens and Kate Gregory. Attending his talk may result in a complete loss of faith in the computer industry's ability to solve the problems it has thrust upon mankind.

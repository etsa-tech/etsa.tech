Make tiny scripts to simplify your non-coder work life. Learn a little bit of JavaScript to make time in your non-coder life :)

Do you find yourself clicking the same buttons over and over? Do you look for your name in the same long list of names multiple times a day? Do you find yourself copying and pasting from the same table over a hundred times?

Put a little JavaScript in your browser bookmarks to automate those tasks!

Extra: learn how to keep your bookmarks bar visible in your modern browser!

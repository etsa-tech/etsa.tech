ARM, as of 2013, is the most widely used 32-bit instruction set architecture, and is used approximately 95% of all smartphones. After some brief comments on the history ARM and the differences between ARM and x86 architecture, she will talk about current ARM developments and some cool projects using ARM-based CPUs.

If you have an ARM project you have built or are working on (RaspberryPi, Arduino ARM, or any other ARM-based system), bring it along so we can do a bit of show and tell. I will be bringing a couple of RaspberryPis as well as the usual mobile platform suspects.

The Bourne Again Shell (Bash) is not just an interactive shell for Linux devices; it is also a powerful interpretive language capable of empowering you to take your automation to the next level. Learn how the Bash builtins can make your scripts faster, portable, and, most importantly, more fun. For example, did you know you can load a template email from a text file into an array, replace placeholder terms, then email it out over a direct TCP socket without calling anything other than "/bin/bash"? Learn all that and more!

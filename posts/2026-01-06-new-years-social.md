New Years Social

By popular demand, we will be holding our New Years Social. We will be gathering between 6-7PM at KEC downtown and taking a group vote to decide on where to go eat from there. We do require you to RSVP for this event so we can have an accurate head count as we call around to places ahead of time to get ideas on who can accommodate our large group. We can't wait to see you all!

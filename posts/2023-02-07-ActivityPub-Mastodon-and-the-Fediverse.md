The great #twittermigration is underway, as people leave Twitter for Mastodon. But, really, what's interesting about that!? Well, underpinning Mastodon is a networking protocol— ActivityPub.

ActivityPub interconnects the entire social media Fediverse, slightly but fundamentally changing how social media networks operate. Come find out how you can run your own little corner of the Fediverse on ActivityPub.

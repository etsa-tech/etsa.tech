CVE-2024-3094, more commonly known as "The xz-utils backdoor", was a near miss for global cybersecurity. Had this attack not been discovered in the nick of time by Andres Freund, most of our planet's SSH servers would have begun granting root access to the party behind this attack. Unfortunately, too much analysis has focused on how malicious code made its way into the xz-utils repo. Instead, I'd like to argue that two longstanding design decisions in critical open source software are what made this attack possible: linking OpenSSH against SystemD, and the existence of GNU IFUNC.

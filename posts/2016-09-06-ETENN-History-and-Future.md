    bio: >-
      Jesse Trucks has been involved with the formation and management of
      professional communities for over 13 years. His initiation into
      professional community involvement began with co-authoring, as part of a
      committee, the original version of the Code of Ethics currently adopted by
      The League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA), USENIX, and
      LISA. In the following years, he helped manage a local SAGE chapter (the
      precursor to LISA); was a Founding Member of LOPSA; formed and managed the
      successful LOPSA Madison Local Chapter; served on the LOPSA Board of
      Directors from 2007 - 2013; founded and still manages the LOPSA East
      Tennessee Local Chapter; and is a senior freenode IRC network staff member
      and the freenode Sponsor Liaison. Over the years, Trucks has seen how
      professional communities wax and wane through successes and failures, and
      he advocates that all professionals get involved in their own professional
      communities to the betterment of everyone involved.

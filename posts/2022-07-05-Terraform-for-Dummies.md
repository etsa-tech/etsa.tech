Have you ever sat there and wondered, how the heck did I get this far without knowing IaC? Or have you been curious about how you can do remote state and dynamic git pre-commit to validate your code for you? Well Wesley did both of those. Somehow he found his way in a rut and finally got out of it with Terraform, and he has been able to build upon that. At this meetup, you will learn Terraform from the ground up and see live demos from resource blocks to modules, to dynamic commits.

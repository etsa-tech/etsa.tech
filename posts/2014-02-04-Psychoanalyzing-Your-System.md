A dive into the minds of your systems and understanding what makes them tick and, more importantly, break. This talk will skim the technical top of how CPU, network, IO, and memory issues can make a system seem like its "gone crazy". We will cover this material via a general technical overview as well as examples and with a few tricks tossed in to keep things interesting.

Most of the tools and examples mentioned in this talk will be Linux based but the content is very general in nature and can be applied to all types of systems.

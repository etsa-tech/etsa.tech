      Jesse Trucks has been involved with the formation and management of
      professional communities for over 13 years. His inception into professional
      community involvement began with co-authoring, as part of a committee, the

      Professional System Administrators (LOPSA), USENIX, and LISA. In the
      following years, he helped manage a local SAGE chapter (the precursor to
      LISA); was a Founding Member of LOPSA; formed and managed the successful
      LOPSA Madison Local Chapter; served on the LOPSA Board of Directors from
      2007 - 2013; founded and still manages the LOPSA East Tennessee Local

The creation and maintenance of specific and intentional communities is far more difficult than most people realize. It may seem natural that like-minded people want to spend time together discussing topics of mutual interest and building camaraderie, but maintaining a high level of interaction and interest with only occasional contact is difficult. Trucks will talk about how these communities, like LOPSA East Tennessee, are formed, nurtured, and sustained through time. Expect an interactive presentation as Trucks wants input from the audience!

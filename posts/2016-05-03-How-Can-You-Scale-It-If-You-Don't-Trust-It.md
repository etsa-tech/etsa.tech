When you scale up an infrastructure, it is crucial that you can trust that you have the right resources in play, the right code deployed, and that information can only flow in a secure manner. When you scale the organization, trust is required among all of the people responsible for coding, testing, deploying, and managing the applications that power the business.

With all of the chatter around scaling, you would think someone would have told you the key ingredient
necessary for creating and fostering the required trust. Unfortunately, it is very easy to get to the end of the
diving board, right on the edge of jumping into something like a hybrid cloud deployment, before you realize
you need to figure this out on your own.

This talk can help. We’ll discuss some concrete ways you can engineer trust into the system (complete with examples) that you are building or operating so that it works well for cloud-native and legacy applications. By the end, you’ll have a good idea of the decision/enforcement points you’ll need to consider to be able to create a system (and an organization) that can scale.

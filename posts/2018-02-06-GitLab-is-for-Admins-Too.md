Most Devs' ears will perk up at this, but it should also catch the attention of ops folks, too. The same single user experience GitLab offers to developers for navigating the complexities of software development, it also offers to admins for managing a no less complex infrastructure. This talk will highlight several GitLab features of particular relevance to sysadmins. If you're interested in a low-cost, easy-to-use tool for making your life easier, then join us for this meeting!

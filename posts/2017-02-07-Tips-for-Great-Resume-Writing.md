This talk is about those simple and not-so simple issues that you insert in to your résumé, the formatting, and from your personal life that make me want to see which of my co-workers recycled it 1st.

Think your resume is perfect? please bring yours four part of this educational and interactive talk where you will be judge, jury and executioner of your own future and move from first on the discard stack to the point where I'm Itching to give you an on-sight interview.

Your resume has as many subtle and not so sublte flaws as the ones that I've inserted in this description and you likely don't know it, no matter how detailed you think you are.

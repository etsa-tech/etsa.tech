In the early days, folks weren't too sure about this new security department that started popping up. Most "hacks" were defacements of websites done by activists and kids - nothing too worrisome. Then, in the mid-2000s the first major breaches started getting reported. Thrilled that the mainstream was starting to take security more seriously, the security community started to take itself a bit too seriously. Security became the department of "no". In many organizations, security folks became patronizing and adversarial. It wasn't a great look and we're still trying to fix our public image. Fast forward to today and security has been relatively humbled. Breaches happen every day, but they rarely cause lasting damage and almost never kill businesses. DevOps, agile, cloud, and the ever-growing VC/startup culture have transformed technology. This transformation has led to a hard split in the security community that's starting to look a bit like the split between sysadmins when Linux came on the scene in the 90's. How does this "new" security practitioner differ from the "old"? This talk will explore the differences between them, including analysis of actual job postings, and some fun anecdotes.

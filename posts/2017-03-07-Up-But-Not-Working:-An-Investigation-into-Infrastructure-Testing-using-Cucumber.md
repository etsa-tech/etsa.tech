    bio: "Bruce Wilson is an Enterprise Architect at ORNL, working particularly on authentication, authorization, remote access, and mobility.  He is a chemist by original training, and he spent 18 years in the chemical industry, working for Eastman Chemical Company, Dow Corning, and the Dow Chemical Company.  Much of that work was very data-intensive, particularly the work on high throughput methods in material sciences.  He migrated from writing tools to help get his own work done to making those tools available to others, to taking on more of an IT role in enabling scientists to do science."

The monitoring system says the server is up and ping works. But that doesnâ€™t always mean the application or the infrastructure is working. That often requires several systems are working together and meaningful tests have to have credentials.

This talk will show some work using Cucumber (a domain specific language for testing), along with the Watir web driver, as a tool to do functional tests of systems.

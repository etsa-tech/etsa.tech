On June 13, 2025, LOPSA National published a [blog post](https://lopsaetenn.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e619044ef91a8f2f403722070&id=38a4e049a4&e=9ec91ac09d) announcing their decision to dissolve the LOPSA National Board. As many of you know, our journey toward independence began in 2017 when we transitioned to become ETSA. Throughout this journey, the LOPSA brand has remained close to our hearts, and while we are saddened to see them step away, we fully support their decision as the right step for the broader community.

Over the past two years, you’ve likely noticed that within our local chapter, we’ve gradually phased out LOPSA branding and now proudly present ourselves solely as ETSA. We believe this move best positions us to serve our members independently while honoring our roots, which stretch back to 2012.

We look forward to continuing to grow and serve the Knoxville community for another 13 years and beyond.

Thank you for being part of our journey.

Sincerely,
Wesley Kirkland

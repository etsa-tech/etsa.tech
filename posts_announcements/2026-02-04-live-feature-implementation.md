Hello ETSA Community!

We're excited to announce that we're implementing a brand new announcements system **live** tonight with our attendees! This is a test announcement to demonstrate how the new feature works.

## What's New?

The announcements system allows us to:

1. **Publish announcements** based on date via markdown files
2. **Display the latest announcement** prominently on the homepage
3. **Show the last 3 announcements** on a dedicated announcements page
4. **Link to individual announcements** using the same slug pattern as our blog posts

## How It Works

Announcements are stored as markdown files in the `posts_announcements` directory, just like our blog posts and presentations. They support:

- Full markdown formatting
- Tags for categorization
- Date-based sorting
- Static site generation for optimal performance

## Try It Out!

You can view all announcements at [/announcements](/announcements) or click on the announcement banner on the homepage to read more.

Thank you for being part of this live implementation session!
